           "react"playground allows user to interact with a chosen LLM and
            optional RAG retriever. You can create new RAG workspaces via the{" "}

          <h2> Smart Model</h2>
          <p> The Smart Model is set as the default model option. It automatically routes your input to the model
            best suited for the task. To see which model was selected, see settings for the Metadata option. 
            Of course, you are also encouraged to experiment with multiple models, and find your favorites!

          <h3>Settings</h3>
          <p>
            You can configure additional settings for the LLM via the setting
            action at the bottom-right. You can change the Temperature and Top P
            values to be used for the answer generation. You can also enable and
            disable streaming mode for those models that support it (the setting
            is ignored if the model does not support streaming). Turning on
            Metadata displays additional information about the answer, such as
            the prompts being used to interact with the LLM and the document
            passages that might have been retrieved from the RAG storage.

          <h3>Multimodal chat</h3>
          <p>
            If you select a multimodal model (like Anthropic Claude 3), you can
            upload images to use in the conversation.
          </p>
          <h3>Session history</h3>
          <p>
            All conversations are saved and can be later accessed via the{" "}
            <Link to="/chatbot/sessions">Session</Link> in the navigation bar.
